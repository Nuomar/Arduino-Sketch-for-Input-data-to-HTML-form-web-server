# Arduino-Sketch-for-Input-data-to-HTML-form-web-server

## Project Overview

In this project, we will use the same asynchronous web server but this time we will save the data entered by the user in the input fields to the ESP flash memory SPIFFS. The current values saved in the respective variables will also get displayed in the web server. The figure below shows how the web server looks like:
